Home Server project

What this is?
- My home server project ideas
- Some install instructions in case I forget them, possibly config files


Must have:
  - Proxmox ( On a physical host, for running all vms/containers)
  - DNS server (Access services/VMs by name)
  - Guacamole (RDP, SSH, VNC access for all VMs)
 
Could be useful:
  - NAS, backups
  - Gitea (self-hosted git repos)
  - CI/CD pipline
  - Plex (Video streaming)
  - Pi-hole (Ad firewall)
  - OwnCloud
  - Codiad/Theia (cloud IDE)
  - TorrentBox
  - some music streamer
  - dev boxes/docker containers for breaking stuff
  - Wiki
